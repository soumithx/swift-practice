classes -> Reference Types
struct -> Value Types 

* if a instance of class A  is assigned to another instance B , 
  any effected properties of A will be refleced to B properties 
 this kind of scenario is Refrence Type

--> if we need an instance of an object through the app and to control its identity , Class are the solution



Value Type: 

Unlike Class Reference Type , properties will not effect any other copied/assigned instance 
it will be helpful to track peace of code
